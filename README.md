# yad2_promoter_chrome_extension
A Chrome Extension that aims to make promoting [Yad2](http://www.yad2.co.il/) ads easier

## What's this extension for?
* Notifies you when you can promote ("להקפיץ") an ad
* Promotes all of your ads in one click
## Badge explanations
The extension uses Badges (small characters at the bottom right of the extension button) to signal the status of your ads:
* __&#10003;__ means all your ads are up to date
* __(Number)__ means you can click the extension to promote (Number) of ads. E.g., if the number __2__ appears, there are 2 ads you may promote.
* __!__ means the extension cannot fetch your ads, probably because you're not logged into your Yad2 profile. To fix this, [login](https://my.yad2.co.il/login.php) to Yad2 and click the extension button again.
